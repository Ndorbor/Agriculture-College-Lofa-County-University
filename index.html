    <h3>General Information</h3></center>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    The College of Agriculture is one of the six Colleges at the Lofa County University. Currently, the College is made up of four departments:
    <ul> 
    <li> General Agriculture</li>
    <li> Agronomy </li>
    <li> Crop science </li>
    <li> Animal Science</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Mission</h3>
    The College of Agriculture is devoted to excellence in promoting cutting-edge technology, knowledge and providing academic leadership, equipping students with the competencies and confidence they need to solve agricultural problems and support them to work in a professional agricultural setting. High ethical standards and unwavering academic excellence and curiosity are top of the College of Agriculture’s priority.
    <p>The College of Agriculture is committed to the concept of teaching agriculture that educates our students; provide practical and productive learning opportunities that will help them develop their capacities for problem solving. </p>
    <p>The College of Agriculture also seeks to contribute constructively to national development through the production of highly qualified and skilled graduates who will serve as potential employees of various agricultural entities. </p>
    <p>Practical teaching, generating new innovations through research and extension and developing proven agricultural practices to be transferred to farmers and other stakeholders are the key focus of the College of Agriculture. </p>
    <h3>Vision</h3>
    To be a leading center for academic excellence, innovation and productive learning geared toward maximizing agriculture and food production with high ethical standards in Liberia and the Sub-region.
    <h3>Program Description:</h3>
    The Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) program in Agriculture and Food Sciences is a precise and broad-based curriculum designed to develop high quality graduates who through productive teaching, research and practical extension services will be able to deliver needed expertise in the areas of agronomy, crop production and improvement, animal production and management couple with agro-business skills.
    <p>From the curriculum, the freshman and sophomore levels of the B.Sc. Agriculture and Food Sciences Program will be spent on core courses which will capacitate students in areas relating to agriculture (basic sciences and fundamentals of professional agriculture program like agronomy, crop science and animal science).</p>
    <p>In the junior level of study (year three), students are free to choose any of the following majors: Agronomy, Crop Science, Animal Science to be their area of specialization, or can decide to continue with General Agriculture. The respective majors will appear on student transcript and degree certificates (e.g. B.Sc. Crop Science). </p>
    <h3>Agronomy-Major</h3>
    The objective of this major is to build high quality graduates with the requisite competencies and skills for sustainable management of crops and the soil where crops grow. Hence, students specializing in Agronomy after their freshman and sophomore levels in general agriculture will:
    <ul>
    <li>Gain vital skills and competencies in agronomy that will enable them understand crop production and better soil management practices that enhance plant yields. </li>
    <li>Use skills gained to solve agronomic problems as employees of various government and non-governmental entities (NGOs) in and out of the country. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Crop Science- Major</h3>
    The objective of this discipline is to build and train graduates with requisite knowledge and skills that will enhance their crop management, crop improvement and extension services capabilities. Graduates from this program will be cloth with the following competencies:
    <ul>
    <li>Contribute to best crop production practices that will enhance crop improvement and yield.</li>
    <li>Manage and run a successful crop enterprise or business. </li>
    <li>Disseminate innovative crop production technologies to farmers and other stakeholders in society. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Animal Science –Major</h3>
    The objective of this discipline is to produce graduates with the necessary competencies and skills to effectively and efficiently raise and manage livestock for production and profitability. Upon completion of this program graduates will be able to:
    <ul>
    <li>Adequately address all aspect of livestock management from different disciplines point of view. </li>
    <li>Set up and successfully run a livestock enterprise or business.</li>
    <li>Demonstrate sustainable livestock production in all agro-ecological zones of Liberia. </li>
    <li>Each Academic year shall consist of two (2) semesters which run for four months each. </li> <li>Candidates for B.Sc. Agriculture and Food Sciences shall participate and complete course work, laboratory and practical work that may be applicable to the program. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Candidates are required to undertake field practices (industrial attachment), after completion of their junior level courses. During the field attachment, students are expected to embark on research projects, which they must complete and present at a seminar during the senior year of study.</p>
    <p>In the Junior and Senior Years of study, students are free to choose any of the majors as their specialty; Agronomy, Crop Science and Animal Science or student may decide to continue with the General Agriculture program. Majors are only selected after the completion of sophomore levels. </p>
    <h3>Program Objectives:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Instruct courses in all branches of agriculture that will be grounded in practical context to give students pragmatic meaning of courses taught in the college of agriculture. </li>
    <li>Equip students with industrial and agro-business skills and competencies. </li>
    <li>Teach courses leading to the award of Bachelor of Science Degree in the four disciplines of agriculture. </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Curriculum</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>All courses offered in the College shall have a four letter code (AGRI) except for Animal and Crop Sciences courses which will carry three letter code (ANS, COS) </li>
    <li>All courses offered in the department shall have three Arabic Numbers and shall be placed in two categories: odd and even ending numbers. </li>
    <li>All odd-ending number courses (1,3,5,7,…..9), shall be offered during the first semester of each academic semester. If the University cannot offer any of these courses as stipulated, it will be offered in the subsequent semester or during vacation school when the demands arise. Vacation school courses will be limited only to practical courses example Agri. 221. </li>
    <li>All even-ending number courses (0,2,4……8), shall be offered in the second semester of each academic year. If not, the subsequent semester or vacation school as and when the situation demands. </li>
